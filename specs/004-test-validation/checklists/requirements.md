- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning
- All user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Test file documentation requirement (FR-008 through FR-010) ensures self-documenting tests
- Manual verification requirements (FR-011, FR-012) establish tests as source of truth
- Edge cases appropriately identify uncertainties around cgtcalc comparison and HMRC rule changes
