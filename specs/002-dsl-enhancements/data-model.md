# Data Model: DSL Enhancements

**Feature**: `002-dsl-enhancements`
**Date**: 2025-11-27

## Entities

No changes to the core data model (entities, attributes, relationships) are required for this feature, as it primarily focuses on enhancing the Domain Specific Language (DSL) syntax and validation of existing functionality. The `Transaction` and `Operation` structs, along with `Section104Holding`, `Match`, and `TaxReport`, remain as defined in the base `cgt-core` feature specification.
