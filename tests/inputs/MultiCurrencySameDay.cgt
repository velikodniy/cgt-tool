# Test: MultiCurrencySameDay
# Purpose: Tests same-day matching with multi-currency transactions
# Rules Tested: Same Day matching, FX conversion
# Complexity: Medium
# Key Features: Buy in USD, sell in GBP on same day
# Expected Outcome: Same-day match with FX conversion
#
# Verification Status: Pending
# Verification Notes:
#   This tests that when shares are bought in USD and sold in GBP on the
#   same day, the same-day matching rule still applies. Both amounts are
#   converted to GBP using that day's FX rate.
#
#   Transaction details:
#   - 2024-06-15: BUY 100 shares @ $150.00 USD (need FX rate for June 2024)
#   - 2024-06-15: SELL 100 shares @ £120.00 GBP
#
#   Same day rule applies: sale matches with same-day purchase.
#   USD purchase needs FX conversion using June 2024 GBP/USD rate.
#
# Note: FX rates are bundled in cgt-money. June 2024 USD rate is ~1.27 GBP.
# Buy cost in GBP: 100 × $150 / 1.27 ≈ £11,811.02
# Sell proceeds: 100 × £120 = £12,000
# Expected gain: ~£188.98
